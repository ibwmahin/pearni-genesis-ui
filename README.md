# pearNI — 3:30 Documentary-Style Video Script

**Total runtime:** 3:30 (210s)

---

## 0:00 – 0:12 (0:12) — Opening hook

**Audio (VOICE, calm but urgent):**  
“Imagine an intelligence that turns space data into solutions for life on Earth — from the farm to the lab, from climate response to breakthrough science.”

**On-screen text:**  
_pearNI — Next-Gen AI Platform for Humanity’s Future_ (logo reveal)

**B-roll / visuals:**  
Rapid montage: satellite imagery → farmers in field → lab researchers → city skyline → planet Earth from orbit. Strong cinematic music bed.

**SFX:** Subtle whoosh between shots.

---

## 0:12 – 0:35 (0:23) — What pearNI is (elevator)

**VOICE:**  
“pearNI is an AI platform that leverages NASA data to accelerate scientific discovery, automate knowledge, and deliver global solutions — all while strengthening human collaboration and creating next-gen AI.”

**On-screen text (bulleted, appearing one-by-one):**

- Scientific Discovery
- Knowledge Automation
- Global Solutions
- Human Collaboration
- AI Creation

**B-roll:** slow pan of the pearNI UI (homepage/demo), overlays of datasets and graphs.

**Note / citation overlay (small corner):**

## 0:35 – 1:10 (0:35) — The problem we solve

**VOICE:**  
“We face too much data and not enough insight. Scientists drown in literature; governments need faster climate insight; farmers must make crop decisions from uncertain weather and soil data. pearNI transforms raw, high-volume NASA and multi-source data into actionable intelligence.”

**On-screen text:**  
_Problem: Data overload → Slow decisions → Reduced impact_

**B-roll:**  
Overlaid scenes: pages of research, scrolling code, satellite feeds, a worried farmer checking a phone.

**VO continuation (short):**  
“This project was built for the NASA Space Apps community to turn Earth and space data into practical action.”

**Citation (small):** NASA Space Apps context: [spaceappschallenge.org](https://www.spaceappschallenge.org)

## 1:10 – 1:45 (0:35) — How it works (the engines — concise)

**VOICE:**  
“pearNI is organized into modular ‘engines’ — each an AI stack tuned for a mission.”

1. **Scientific Discovery Engine** — automated literature review, hypothesis generation, experiment design (low-latency, secure, explainable).
2. **Knowledge Automation Engine** — document processing, knowledge graph creation, multi-source integration.
3. **Global Solutions Engine** — predictive models for climate, resources and global health.
4. **Human Collaboration Engine** — intuitive human-AI interfaces and collaborative decision-making.
5. **AI Creation Engine** — automated architecture search for self-improving agents.

**On-screen text:** Short two-line callouts for each engine as VO mentions it.

**B-roll:** Animated schematic showing data → engines → outputs (dashboards, alerts, research reports).

**Citation overlay:** Features described on project site: [pearni.netlify.app](https://pearni.netlify.app)

## 1:45 – 2:25 (0:40) — Real people use it: from a farmer to a researcher

**VOICE:**  
“pearNI isn’t only for labs — it’s for people.”

**Use case 1 (Farmer, 0:1-0:20 of this block):**  
“A farmer receives a simple advisory: when to irrigate, which fields face drought risk, and how to optimize fertilizer — all derived from NASA remote sensing plus local soil data.”

**Visuals:** Farmer gets a short text/push alert, checks map overlay showing moisture and recommended action. Close-ups of crops improving.

**Use case 2 (Community Planner):**  
“City planners receive resource-allocation forecasts to prepare for floods or heatwaves.”

**Visuals:** Town map with color-coded risk layers.

**Use case 3 (Advanced researcher):**  
“A researcher uses automated literature synthesis and hypothesis generation to design an experiment — cutting months of prep to days.”

**Visuals:** Researcher highlights generated hypotheses, runs a simulation on-screen.

**On-screen text:**  
_From farmer to researcher — practical, accessible, and powerful._

**VO:**  
“Inputs scale — simple mobile alerts for local users; advanced APIs and notebook outputs for specialists.”

---

## 2:25 – 3:00 (0:35) — Impact at scale (global solutions & trustworthy AI)

**VO:**  
“At planetary scale, pearNI helps policy-makers and NGOs plan for climate resilience, track resource allocation, and monitor global health markers. And it’s built for trust: low-latency, secure, scalable and explainable outputs.”

**B-roll:**  
Worldwide maps with time-lapse overlays, dashboards with forecasts, scenes of teams coordinating disaster response.

**On-screen text:**  
_Scalable · Secure · Explainable · Real-time_

**Citation overlay:** Platform design and capabilities summarized from project materials: [pearni.netlify.app](https://pearni.netlify.app)

## 3:00 – 3:20 (0:20) — Why it matters / call to action

**VO (inspiring):**  
“Turning space-derived data into human-scale action is not a lofty dream — it’s a necessity. pearNI makes that bridge — equipping anyone, anywhere, to make better decisions for people and planet.”

**On-screen text + CTA:**  
_See the demo. Join the mission. pearNI (pearni.netlify.app)_

**B-roll:** Quick UI demo clip showing a one-click data query and an instantly generated advisory.

# Production notes & tips (quick)

- **Pacing:** Keep narration tight — the script above is designed for natural pacing. If narrator speaks fast, drop one small example to avoid rushing.
- **Visual assets to capture:** screen-recorded demo of pearNI UI, satellite imagery overlays, closeups of team members, hands-on farmer footage, researcher at computer. The pearNI site is the authoritative product visual; use that UI for credibility. ([pearni.netlify.app](https://pearni.netlify.app))
- **Text overlay style:** Short, bold phrases; avoid long paragraphs on screen.
- **Music & voice:** Start cinematic, then shift to warmer/optimistic during use-case section. End on uplifting tone.
- **Subtitles:** Always include — improves accessibility and hackathon judges’ quick reviewing.
- **Length check:** Total segments come to 3:30. Time each VO pass during recording to ensure fidelity.
